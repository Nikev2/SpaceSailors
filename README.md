Share this on any social media you want as long as you don't monetize it. Yes I don't want my script becoming a linkvertise for those diehard roblox exploiting youtubers that you see with their virus links

So I made a script that AutoFarms in this space game. It only does it for Mars and Ceres since those are the planets I could get it to do. All you do is put the script below into a file in AutoExec ( aslo
called AutoExecute). Join the game and toggle AutoFarm when the GUI appears then wait for it to teleport you about 3-4 seconds. If you toggle Disable Auto Farm then please wait for it to finish the current auto farm or just rejoin the game to refresh.

-It skips the whole hassle of leaving the moon it just teleports you back to the orbiter

-It gives you 800-1000 if you have no multiplier.

V1 script: The first verison uses the basic landers and can go to random planets

```lua
------ Put this in your AutoExecuteFolder
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikev2/SpaceSailors/main/Loader"))()
```
V2 script: Adds the new landers in the game (MAIN SCRIPT) 
```lua
------ Put this in your AutoExecuteFolder 
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikev2/SpaceSailors/refs/heads/main/v2loader.lua"))()
```
